CHANGES

  * Added support for incremental path satisfiability checking
  * Added an interactive symbolic debugger
    - The --startdebugger command line option will add a breakpoint at
      the beginning of the 'main' function. From there, you can use
      debugger commands to set later breakpoints, single step, continue
      execution until the next breakpoint, and inspect simulator state.
