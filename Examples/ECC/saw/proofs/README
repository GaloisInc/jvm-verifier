This directory contains the SAWScript method specification and proof
orchestration scripts for ECC.  Unless specifically noted, they all
pertain to the 64-bit Java implementation of ECC (i.e., the verification
targets all come from the P384ECC64 class and its superclasses).  The
Java ECC implementation may be found in ../../src/, and the Cryptol
reference specification in ../spec/ecc.cry.

JAVA CLASS FILES

We include pre-generated Java class files built with JRE 1.6.  In order
to rebuild these, run the (cd ../.. && make build) command from within
this directory (on Windows without a GNU make available, invoking the
Java compiler manually as per the Makefile will be sufficient).

SBV FILES

We include pre-generated SBV models of the Cryptol ECC specification,
but any code changes will necessitate rebuilding these and a Cryptol
installation (>= 1.8.22) will need to be available.  To regenerate these
SBV files, run the ../spec/sbv/make_sbvs script.

RUNNING THE PROOFS

The current collection of SAWScript proofs for the ECC implementation is:

  - Dependent on JDK 1.6; please see the SAWScript tutorial for details
    on setting up the JDK and specifying its location to SAWScript
    (i.e., for determining the value of <PATH_TO_JDK1.6_JAR> below)

  - Dependent on Yices 2, available for download at http://yices.csl.sri.com

After ensuring that the sawScript executable is in the current path, the
collection of ECC proofs can be run via:

$ sawScript -c../../build -j<PATH_TO_JDK1.6_JAR> toplevel.saw

Note that the Yices executable must also be in the path so that
sawScript can invoke it.  On Windows systems, it may be necessary to add
Yices to the global PATH environment variable rather than to the local
environment of a given cmd.exe instance.
