This directory contains the SAWScript method specification and proof
orchestration scripts.  Unless specifically noted, they all pertain to
the 64-bit Java implementation of ECC (i.e., the verification targets
all come from the P384ECC64 class and its superclasses).

SUMMARY

Run SAWScript on toplevel.saw to run all proofs, or type "make verify"
from the parent directory.

DETAILS

By convention, 

  - method specification files for individual Java methods are named
    with the .spec file suffix.

   - orchestration scripts (which are often just series of import
     statements) are named with the .saw suffix.

This is for convenience; both forms are written in the SAWScript
language.

Orchestration scripts should be used when invoking the sawScript tool to
perform a given proof.  Method specification filenames should be used
inside orchestration scripts to specify proof discharge order when
writing compositional proofs.

This hassle should go away when we implement a better "module" system;
right now we only have the import directive at our disposal, and must
avoid name collisions the hard way.
