This repository contains the code for the Java Symbolic Simulator
(JSS). It is currently used primarily as a library from SAWScript, but
also produces a stand-alone executable, `jss`.

For information on using `jss`, see the tutorial in
[doc/japi-tutorial](https://github.com/GaloisInc/jvm-verifier/raw/master/doc/japi-tutorial/).
